<h1>Companies</h1>
<p>These are some of the startup companies, businesses I have founded, and worked on.<br>Some of them are not included here because I pivoted even before it had a name.<br>And I will be completely honest here I was and till some degree still am a guy who lacks patience.(still working on it) this is one reason why my startups failed so far.<br>and also the other reason (main reason) my startups and companies failed is becaues I had partial clarity of what I want to work on and partial clarity of purpose (life task / what you are meant to do)<br>And I don't see any reason to keep this hidden, so I will be honest here again that I have had more clearity of what I want to do since then.<br>for me this clearity comes from deep meditation and writing (mainly), and rarely parts of it while taking a walk and talking to myself.(most self questioning)</bt></p>

        <h3>CASA</h3>
        <p>I started this to help international student find housing in bay area.
            This was the only startup that actually generated revenue: $10 in my venmo.
            The Problem : When Students are looking for housing in Craigslist they don't get any response, and Craigslist was the only place where you could find housing students could afford ($1000), Craigslist was most up to date. Other site had it but no body bothered to update.
